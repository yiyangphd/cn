我的主要研究领域为高维数据中的变量选择方法。变量选择，也被称为特征选择，是许多科学问题的核心，例如寻找人类基因组中的致病基因。

### 1. 基于贝叶斯模型的变量选择

A typical task in many scientific problems is to find important factors in predicting an outcome variable. This task is further complicated by the fact that a factor may consist of a group of variables. I work on statistical methods in this context to identify important (groups of) variables. In particular, I have developed a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that can achieve group selection and within-group variable selection simultaneously. The proposed methods can also account for various correlation structures between the variables. 

### 2. 基于对照变量框架的变量选择

False discoveries render research findings irreproducible, a long-standing challenge to researchers. They often occur when the truly important factors are correlated with the non-important ones. I work on knockoff statistics to design knockoff variables that preserve the correlation structure of the original variables. This property allows a variable selection procedure based on the knockoff variables to control the false discovery rate in the presence of correlation between the important and non-important variables.
